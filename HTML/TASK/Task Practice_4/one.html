            <p>A hot air balloon is a type of aircraft that flies using heated air. It consists of a large fabric
                envelope, typically made of nylon, that holds the hot air, and a basket (or gondola) beneath it to carry
                passengers and the pilot. The balloon rises because hot air is less dense than cooler air, providing
                lift.

                A burner positioned above the basket heats the air inside the envelope, allowing the balloon to ascend,
                while releasing hot air or allowing it to cool causes descent. Hot air balloons are often used for
                recreational flights and are a popular sight at festivals due to their colorful designs and graceful
                movement through the sky.</p>
